"NEW YORK – For the second year in a row, global banks made more money underwriting bonds and providing loans for green projects than they earned from financing oil, gas and coal activities. ","The world’s biggest lenders generated a total of about US$3 billion (S$4 billion) in fees in 2023 from lining up debt for deals marketed as environmentally friendly, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. By comparison, the sector brought in less than US$2.7 billion in aggregate earnings from fossil fuel transactions. European banks led the transition, with BNP Paribas topping Bloomberg’s green debt league table. Meanwhile, Wall Street dominated fossil finance, with Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase generating the biggest earnings from oil and gas deals. BNP, the European Union’s largest bank, got close to US$130 million in 2023 from its green finance business. Credit Agricole was next with US$96 million and then HSBC Holdings with US$94 million. On the other side of the energy divide, Wells Fargo earned fees of US$107 million from arranging bonds and loans for the fossil fuel sector, followed closely by JPMorgan and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), both with US$106 million. To be sure, MUFG was also the top arranger of global green loans in 2023. The development coincides with stricter regulations in Europe, where both the European Central Bank and the region’s top banking authority have made clear they want the finance industry to speed up its green transition. Lenders in Europe now face the threat of fines and higher capital requirements if they mismanage climate exposures. In response, many banks are imposing explicit restrictions on fossil finance.
 In the United States, meanwhile, the regulatory outlook remains uncertain and fragmented as many Republican states place hurdles in the way of the green transition. Banks suspected of withholding financing from the oil and gas sector increasingly face retaliation, with Texas among states threatening to cut off Wall Street firms that embrace net-zero emission goals. Against that backdrop, the global finance industry has fallen well short of where it needs to be if the goals of the Paris climate agreement are to be met. According to an analysis by BloombergNEF (BNEF), four times as much capital needs to be allocated to green projects as to fossil fuels by 2030 to align with net-zero emission targets. Yet at the end of 2022, that ratio was just 0.7 to 1, largely unchanged from the previous year, BNEF’s latest figures show. Bank financing is not “anywhere close” to the transition levels needed, said Ms Trina White, a sustainable finance analyst at BNEF, when the December report was published. The perceived foot-dragging by global banks has environmentalists sounding the alarm.
 “Banks still aren’t keeping pace with the rate of transition that is required to avoid catastrophic climate change,” said Mr Jason Schwartz, senior communications strategist at Sunrise Project, a non-profit that is focused on the financial sector’s contribution to global warming. The shifting trends of 2023 are “more indicative of broader macroeconomic trends than any proactive efforts in the banking sector to reduce financing for carbon-intensive energy”, said Ms Adele Shraiman, senior campaign strategist at the Sierra Club, a grassroots environmental organisation in the United States. “The reality is that banks aren’t transitioning their energy financing quickly enough to meet their own climate goals.”  Last year was the hottest on record, according to the Global Carbon Project. The group, which represents an international collaboration of scientists, estimates that carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels rose 1.1 per cent to a new high in 2023, putting the planet on track to exceed its carbon budget for 1.5 deg C of warming by the end of the decade. Overall, banks extended US$583 billion in green bonds and loans in 2023, compared with US$527 billion of fossil fuel debt. In 2022, banks channelled US$594 billion into environmental projects, and US$558 billion into oil, gas and coal, the Bloomberg data showed. For several years now, the world’s biggest banks have published reports showing the vast sums of money they say they are allocating towards a greener, fairer planet. But some of those assertions are now being questioned amid an absence of regulatory guideposts to help stakeholders make sense of such claims. BLOOMBERG",straitstimes,Oil and Gas,Singapore
"SINGAPORE – Oil refiners are finding it harder to secure funding for projects as more banks shy away from fossil fuel financing, with plant owners now pressed to show that their businesses have cleaner-energy goals, executives said.","While the business is still profitable, getting financing is more challenging, according to Mr Alwyn Bowden, chief executive officer of Malaysia’s Pengerang Energy Complex.  From the point of view of many lenders, “if you have the word ‘refinery’ anywhere in your title, you’re not going to get finance”, Mr Bowden told the Asian Downstream Summit. The summit was held at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre on Wednesday and Thursday.  With the threat from climate change growing and the world trying to move towards net-zero emissions goals, Mr Bowden’s comments highlight a growing struggle for the industry.  Despite worldwide crude demand hitting an all-time high in 2023, lenders have become more wary of offering funding.  That has left the global refining system stretched, raising the risk of bottlenecks and volatile prices. The apparent mismatch between sustained hydrocarbon demand and a reluctance to invest in capacity or keep plants open has spurred global tensions in recent years.  When fuel costs spiked in 2022, Saudi Arabia’s top oil official laid the blame on a refining crunch and not on any shortage of crude. Now, plant owners will need to show that their business is in the process of transitioning to net-zero carbon dioxide emissions, Mr Bowden added on Wednesday.  For Pengerang Energy’s upcoming refinery, that push includes plans to use the plant’s waste products as fuel, as well as electrifying some operations, he said. Indonesia’s state-owned Pertamina has been able to attain financing, according to Ms Maria Katryn, senior financing manager at Kilang Pertamina. The company has environmental projects but has yet to fully curb emissions, she said.  Banks have placed more restrictions on financing oil and gas, with the expectation that the world will soon need less of them, said Mr Roger Charles, executive director of sustainability at DBS Bank.  A realistic narrative for energy-transition plans is key to accessing financing, he added.  Even then, pitching sustainable businesses comes with its pitfalls. “There are a lot of examples of greenwashing, where people – due to various pressures – get forced to commit to something which they cannot,” said Mr Mayank Vishnoi, chief financial officer of ChemOne Group.

"SINGAPORE (THE BUSINESS TIMES) - DBS on Thursday (April 30) guided that its oil-and-gas (O&G) lending portfolio at $23 billion makes up its single-largest loan exposure to impacted industries made vulnerable by the Covid-19 pandemic, and that it expects further allowances set aside specifically for O&G support services.","This comes as the bank reported a 29 per cent fall in Q1 net profit that brought its earnings to its lowest level since 2017. Singapore's largest bank opened the results season for the local trio with a large bump in allowances set aside to prepare for hits from the Covid-19 global pandemic.  As at 9.51am, shares of DBS were trading at $19.89, up 69 cents or 3.6 per cent. ""Credit cost will depend upon duration of the slowdown and how collateral values evolve,"" said Jefferies analyst Krishna Guha in a note on Thursday, while keeping a ""buy"" rating on the stock. ""Capital buffer, earlier digitalisation efforts and ample system liquidity put the bank in good stead to face the crisis."" The virus outbreak, which began in late December last year, has roiled global economies and added to the severe stress in the oil industry. The bank has identified eight industries more directly impacted by slowdown in its Q1 update. They are: O&G, aviation, hotels, gaming/cruise ships, tourism, retail, food and beverage, as well as shipping. Of its loan exposure to the ""impacted industries"", O&G makes up the single-largest sector with lending totalling $23 billion.  As an indication, the specific provisions of $383 million taken by DBS reflect one loan to an oil trader that was recognised as a non-performing asset in the quarter. It did not identify the oil trader.  Of the total $5 billion loans to oil traders, 50 per cent are backed by bank letters of credit. It also lends to global traders or state-owned companies. In its lending to support services, three-quarters of its lending exposure - that is, $3 billion out of $4 billion - have been recognised as non-performing assets. The bank expects to take further specific provisions on its exposure to support services, it said. As it is, the bank said it has taken a conservative stance in Q3 2017 to recognise soured exposure to support services, and has marked down collateral. It has a $7 billion loan exposure to oil producers, mainly to oil majors and state-owned companies, the bank said.  The bank showed that of its loans of $221 billion to large corporates - that is, excluding small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - lending to those in ""impacted industries"" stood at $46 billion, or 20 per cent of that loan book. Total specific allowances translate to 35 basis points (bps) of loans. The bank guided that credit costs are to rise to between $3 billion and $5 billion - reflecting 80-130 bps of loans - cumulatively over two years.  This could mean an average of 67 bps of credit costs each year unless all are frontloaded, said CGS-CIMB analyst Andrea Choong in a flash note. She kept her ""hold"" rating on the counter. Total provisions set aside stood at $1.086 billion, comprising a $703 million cushion under general allowances, and the remainder for specific accounts that have gone sour. Of that $46 billion loan exposure to ""impacted industries"", loans to Singapore Inc companies by DBS made up $5 billion. The bank has an SME loanbook of $39 billion, 10 per cent of which is exposed to highly impacted industries such as hotels, food and beverage, and retailers.  Almost 90 per cent of SME exposure is in Singapore and Hong Kong, with that predominantly secured against property. Lending criteria to SMEs have also been tightened over the past two years, the bank guided. Its non-performing loan ratio ticked higher to 1.6 per cent, from 1.5 per cent.  DBS maintained its quarterly dividend payout at 33 cents, but flagged that it would ""adjust dividend policy as appropriate"" according to its ongoing assessment of the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on performance, credit costs and capital ratios. Its net profit for the first quarter for the three months ended March 31, 2020 dropped to $1.165 billion compared with $1.651 billion from the same period a year ago. This is in line with an average estimate of $1.13 billion from four analysts polled by Refinitiv.  The bank guided that its full-year profit before allowances to be around 2019 levels after factoring in declines for the rest of year. DBS's stress-test scenario offers a look at how lenders now see the crisis unfolding. The bank estimated as a base scenario that lockdowns in major economies continue until mid-2020, gradual recovery is seen in the second-half of the year and continues through to muted growth in 2021, while financial markets correct by an overall 20 per cent this year. The bank set its stress scenario by assuming that lockdowns in major economies continue through to end of the third quarter, with economic activity in 2021 ""still materially below"" 2019 levels, and financial markets to correct by 50 per cent in 2020. Under these scenarios, resulting impact on credit costs was comparable to the 2002-03 period and during the global financial crisis in 2008-2009. A Citi report had said that past recession peaks in credit-cost terms stood at up to 200 bps in the Asian financial crisis, and 100 bps in the global financial crisis. The bank has also provided loan moratoriums for more than 1,800 corporate facilities representing over $3.4 billion in total loans outstanding. It has also availed $3.2 billion in loan facilities to Singapore SMEs under the government relief programme. In the housing segment, DBS said its mortgage book stood at $75 billion in total, with minimal losses expected, as in past crises. Close to 8,000 mortgage principal and interest payment applications have been deferred, representing $4.7 billion in loans outstanding.  Net interest margin (NIM) stood at 1.86 per cent for the first quarter, unchanged from a year ago, and down from 1.88 per cent a quarter ago. The bank flagged the lag effect, saying that the NIM in Q1 does not reflect impact of recent interest rate cut. This will only be seen from Q2. Net interest income was up 7 per cent to $2.48 billion.  Fee income rose 14 per cent from a year ago to $832 million, while gains in investment securities boosted its income from other non-interest activities by 39 per cent to $712 million.",straitstimes,Oil and Gas,Singapore
